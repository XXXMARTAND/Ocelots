##The Problem
<HR>
Elections in India and in many developing countries have many security issues to deal with. There also exist several logistics hindrances like center allotment, secure transportation of EVMs etc. In addition many groups of people sometimes find it difficult to reach a center to  exercise their voting right. This maybe due to a number of reasons such as living in a different state, traveling overseas, being physically disabled etc.

  ## The Solution
So our solution is to setup an electronic ballot portal which can be accessed remotely. The system can be guaranteed to be secure as the votes are directly recorded on a Blockchain based Ledger. This project will aid in making the voting system much more transparent and reliable than the technology currently being employed. This will also enable the votes to be counted almost immediately  as the entire process takes place online.

  ## Technology Stack
  The technology stack we plan to employ is Azure Blockchain, Azure Cloud, Microsoft Azure SQL DB, Microsoft NoSQL DB, Entity Framework, Windows Communication Foundation, c#.NET Framework, Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB, Standard Government Data Sets
